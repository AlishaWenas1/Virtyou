      <h4 class="content_subtext mt-4">Brand Vision&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>We started creating our brand by making a brand vision. We have chosen the song Michelle got, namely Yellow by Coldplay. In this song, a sentence grabbed our attention because it reminded us of something that we have been struggling with and of a current issue that is going on in the world. The sentence we used is "I drew a line." We immediately thought of setting and stating boundaries and how they are not always respected. Women and minorities still have to deal with men not listening to their boundaries on a daily basis, thinking that they still have a little more say in certain situations than women and minorities do. For some years, this discussion has gotten much more recognition because of #MeToo on mostly sexual boundary-breaking behavior. A few weeks ago, the program BOOS revealed that several men in the program The Voice of Holland had shown sexual boundary-breaking behavior with many contestants. These stories touched us because even though we have never experienced something significant like this ourselves, we have been in situations where we felt like our boundaries weren't respected or uncomfortable and unable to speak up for ourselves. If we look at the world and how it is today, there are still many rules made by men that make it harder or more vulnerable to speak out, not just about sexually transgressive behavior but in general. That's why we came up with the following brand vision.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="brand_vision">"In a world where people are still living in the rules of the past and patriarchy, we believe that it is vital that people feel safe, protected, and able to voice their feelings and discomforts because only then we can have a fair and civilized society."</p>
		
      <h4 class="content_subtext mt-4">Core Values&nbsp;</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Respect:</strong> We want to contribute to our brand to create more respect among people (also for women and minorities) and hope that this will be the outcome. Because this is an issue that in-volves a lot of respect or, better said, a lack of respect, we intend to always behave re-spectfully to our customers.
	<br>
	<strong>2. Self-Determination:</strong> In our vision, we mention that we believe that people should be able to make their own decisions and show their limits. It should be their choice and initiative to where they want it to go, especially where they want it to stop. This brand seeks to clarify to our customers that they have the right to this self-determination.<br>
	<strong> 3. Safety: </strong> Looking at the issue we are discussing, the world we live in often lacks this security. Cases such as The Voice of Holland show that for years the people who exhibited transgressive behavior could keep doing their thing without being punished for it. Many still feel unsafe when walking, for instance, alone on the street. To bring awareness to this issue, we hope to contribute to more safety.<br>
	<strong> 4. Responsiveness: </strong> We want people to respond and speak up. We encourage this. The more people start to voice themselves, share their experiences and stand up for themselves and others, the more used this world will get to this, and changes will be made. </p>

		<p><strong>Justification Brand Persona</strong><br>
			Demographic information: We interviewed youngsters between 18 and 27 years old. All interviewed youngsters live in the south of the Netherlands, and most of them are students, with a social side job, like sales or catering. According to our interview, they all had the problem we are examining, but women have had the problem more than men.<br><br>

Biography: Most interviewees are students with side jobs and play a sport. Almost all students mentioned watching films and series and being with their friends as things they do in their free time.<br><br>

Personality: The interviewees all said to be party introverted and extroverted. Most of them thought they were a little bit more extroverted. The feelings of being sensing versus intuitive differed, just like with thinking and feeling. Most participants said to be slightly more sensing than intuitive and slightly more feeling than thinking in everyday life. The participants agreed that they like to think of themselves as perceiving instead of judging, but every human judges sometimes. The participants value both family and work but find a family more important.<br><br>

Characteristics: The characteristics mentioned above are characteristics that the interviewees mentioned. 'Social' is one of the most mentioned ones.<br><br>

Quote: The interviewees valued respect for others and found it essential to listen to others instead of thinking and speaking for someone else. Most of them had a strong feeling of justice.<br><br>

Motivation and frustrations: Most youngsters mentioned they want to finish their studies, save money to live on, and get their own house while enjoying their life and living it to the fullest. On the other hand, lies and unfair behavior are not welcome in the interviewees' lives.<br><br>

Communication: Many different platforms are being used by our interviewees, mainly Instagram was mentioned a lot. However, TikTok was also mentioned as one of the apps the interviewees spent most of their time on. They use these apps for communication, for example, with friends and classmates, for information, through the news, and for entertainment, for instance, by watching small videos. They use these apps throughout the day, but especially when they wake up before they go to school and during their break from school/work. They estimated to spend three hours a day on all their social media combined.<br><br>

Brands: Most interviewees find it essential that the brand has a story, with which they mean the brand is transparent in what they do, how to do it, and what they stand for. They want to know the brand is doing 'fair business' and does not make unfair use of materials or people. The mentioned brands are not considered very expensive overall, but the interviewees don't mind paying a little extra when a brand is fair and transparent to them.<br><br>

Factors influencing buying behavior: Apart from the values mentioned above, a brand should be ethical, trustworthy, of good quality, and good customer service (friendly and fast) before the students consider buying the brand.
