      <h4 class="content_subtext mt-4">Brand Vision&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>We started creating our brand by making a brand vision. We have chosen the song Michelle got, namely Yellow by Coldplay. In this song, a sentence grabbed our attention because it reminded us of something that we have been struggling with and of a current issue that is going on in the world. The sentence we used is "I drew a line." We immediately thought of setting and stating boundaries and how they are not always respected. Women and minorities still have to deal with men not listening to their boundaries on a daily basis, thinking that they still have a little more say in certain situations than women and minorities do. For some years, this discussion has gotten much more recognition because of #MeToo on mostly sexual boundary-breaking behavior. A few weeks ago, the program BOOS revealed that several men in the program The Voice of Holland had shown sexual boundary-breaking behavior with many contestants. These stories touched us because even though we have never experienced something significant like this ourselves, we have been in situations where we felt like our boundaries weren't respected or uncomfortable and unable to speak up for ourselves. If we look at the world and how it is today, there are still many rules made by men that make it harder or more vulnerable to speak out, not just about sexually transgressive behavior but in general. That's why we came up with the following brand vision.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="brand_vision">"In a world where people are still living in the rules of the past and patriarchy, we believe that it is vital that people feel safe, protected, and able to voice their feelings and discomforts because only then we can have a fair and civilized society."</p>
		
      <h4 class="content_subtext mt-4">Core Values&nbsp;</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Respect:</strong> We want to contribute to our brand to create more respect among people (also for women and minorities) and hope that this will be the outcome. Because this is an issue that in-volves a lot of respect or, better said, a lack of respect, we intend to always behave re-spectfully to our customers.
	<br>
	<strong>2. Self-Determination:</strong> In our vision, we mention that we believe that people should be able to make their own decisions and show their limits. It should be their choice and initiative to where they want it to go, especially where they want it to stop. This brand seeks to clarify to our customers that they have the right to this self-determination.<br>
	<strong> 3. Safety: </strong> Looking at the issue we are discussing, the world we live in often lacks this security. Cases such as The Voice of Holland show that for years the people who exhibited transgressive behavior could keep doing their thing without being punished for it. Many still feel unsafe when walking, for instance, alone on the street. To bring awareness to this issue, we hope to contribute to more safety.<br>
	<strong> 4. Responsiveness: </strong> We want people to respond and speak up. We encourage this. The more people start to voice themselves, share their experiences and stand up for themselves and others, the more used this world will get to this, and changes will be made. </p>
