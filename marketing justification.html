      <h2 class="content_text"> 2 Marketing</h2>
		<p>In content, we have decided that our brand revolves around the issue of living in a patriarchal world in which women and minorities aren't feeling protected and able to voice their boundaries because not enough attention is paid to it, and the boundaries aren't respected or listened to. Our brand vision is, "In a world where people are still living in the rules of the past and patriarchy, we believe that it is vital that people feel safe, protected, and able to voice their feelings and discom-forts because only then we can have a fair and civilized society." Our core values are safety, respon-siveness, respect, and self-determination. With our product being sweaters with bold statements on them, such as "Fuck Off," "No is No," "My Body My Rules."</p>
		
		<h4 class="content_subtext mt-4">Communication Objectives</h4>
		<p><strong>Reach Objective</strong></p>
      <p>Because we are in the beginning stadium of communicating our brand towards our audience, we focus on creating "brand awareness" (Inkbot Design, 2020). Facebook recommends a source audi-ence of between 1,000 and 50,000 people (Henderson, 2020). However, we are a new brand with having no loyal customers yet, followers, or even people who are aware of our brand. Keeping in mind that our target audience is the age group that is spending the most time on social media (CBS, 2020), we aim to have at least 250 people on Instagram and 300 on TikTok who have seen our message before April 14 2022. In our persona interviews it turned out that the hours spent on these two platforms goes more to TikTok. Therefore, we are more likely to have more views on TikTok than on Instagram, even though both are popular among our target audience.
</p>
      <p class="brand_vision">1. At least 250 people will have seen our messages on our Instagram page before April 14.<br>
2. At least 300 people will have seen our messages on our TikTok page before April 14.</p>
		
		
		<p><strong>Affect Objective</strong></p>
      <p>We described at the reach objective that we want 250 people to see our message on Instagram and 300 people to see our messages on TikTok. We aim to have between 2% and 3% of our follow-er's comment on our posts, which is around 15 people for both platforms in total. We choose 2/3%, because an average engagement rate lies between 1 and 3,5% for Instagram (Polishchuk, 2021). We wanted to challenge ourselves to rise above a low engagement rate to end up in the top of average engagement numbers. But since we are a new brand without financial resources, we think an engagement rate that is higher than average will be hard to accomplish. 
</p>
      <p class="brand_vision">At least 15 people will feel supported and empowered by our brand or will at least agree to disap-prove of crossing someone else's boundaries before April 14 2022.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Response Objective</strong></p>
      <p>This is a result of an engaging feed. As the audience is willing to share their experience with our brand, we will build valuable social proof that can convert potential customers who are on the fence about making a purchase.
</p>
      <p class="brand_vision">Our audience will like and share the page with an average of 150 followers (WorkMacro, 2018) before April 14 2022. </p>
		
      <h4 class="content_subtext mt-4">Target Audience</h4>
      <p><strong>Demographic and Geographic Segmentation: </strong><br>
We have decided to focus on people living in the Netherlands. Although in the whole world patri-archy is still ruling, and the feeling of unsafety, not being protected, or being able to voice bounda-ries is present, we are a new brand with no loyal customers yet. Therefore, we are starting to spread awareness about our brand in the Netherlands. Figures from CBS show that one in ten peo-ple aged 16 and older has experienced sexual abuse, especially women aged 18-24, are victims (CBS, 2020). This includes both physical and non-physical sexual harassment. However, our brand is not only focused on sexual transgressive behavior. When we are talking about a patriarchal world, we are talking about boundaries in general and how women and minorities are still unprivileged compared to men. In the Netherlands, half of the population has a permanent job by age 27 (CBS, 2019). Around that age, most people still must prove themselves at their work and don't have power yet. When we look at some situations in which the issue of a patriarchal world, unsafety, and feeling unable to voice your discomforts, we want to attack with our is very much present, it will be situations such as going out or on the work floor. Therefore, when we are looking at the age of our audience, we choose to target people between ages 18-27. Even though we attack a patriar-chal world that needs to change, we will be targeting all genders. We don't strive with our brand that only women will be helped more and feel safe. We are seeking equality and that everyone will feel saved, protected, and able to voice their feelings. Therefore, we will target all genders that are for equality and the mentioned points. Education does not matter because we do not dif-ferentiate between people with specific education when it comes to feeling safe and able to speak out their boundaries. In addition, as we discussed, the target audience is between the ages of 18-27, which are not the people with the highest income (Karthaus, 2021). Therefore, our brand will not be expensive, and we will target people with all kinds of incomes, but especially people with low-middle incomes.<br>
Country: <em>The Netherlands</em><br>
Age: <em>18-27</em><br>
Gender: <em>All genders</em><br>
Income: <em>Low-middle income</em><br>
Education: <em>All educations</em><br>

		 <p>When looking at the Psychographic Segmentation and Behavioral Segmentation, we used the an-swers we conducted in the persona interviews to determine our target audience's personality traits, values, interests, lifestyles, purchasing habits, user status, brand interactions etc.</p> 
	
	<strong>Psychographic Segmentation: </strong><br>
 Our target audience is very loyal to a brand when they are content with it; however, they are also open to new experiences. They mainly value family and friends, work, and strive for financial stabil-ity and happiness. We focus on empathic people and care about how both the environment and people are treated. They care for equality between all people and seek a solution for the problem of not all people feeling safe, protected, and able to voice their feelings and discomforts.<br>
Attitudes: <em>Loyal to brands, but also open for new experiences</em><br>
Values: <em>Family and friends, work, financial stability, and being happy</em><br>
Personality traits: <em>Empathic
Motivations: Equality between all people</em><br>
Beliefs: <em>Environment and people need to be treated well and with care, need of a solution for not all people feeling safe, protected, and able to voice their feelings and discomforts</em><br>
		<br>
<strong> Behavioral Segmentation:  </strong> Our target audience spends a lot of time on many different platforms/social media. In our persona interviews, Whatsapp, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok were mentioned. How-ever, Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok were mentioned the most. We think Snapchat is not suitable to use in communicating our message. Therefore, we will use Instagram and TikTok to brand our message and product. Instagram and TikTok are both used daily by our target audience. They spend 1-3 hours a day on these platforms, mainly in the morning and the evening (after school or work). Generally, more of this time is spent on TikTok than on Instagram. The two platforms are used for different activities. Instagram is mainly used for socializing, checking out what others have been up to, for informational purposes, and keeping up to date with news. TikTok is mainly used for enter-tainment and getting inspired. In our target audience, it varies significantly from person to person which brands they like. Some brand preferences, for example, are Nike and H&M. They do have matching things they value in a brand, such as good price-quality balance, not too expensive, good reviews, not harmful to the environment or people, doing what it promises to do. Things that turn our target audience off from a brand are high prices, unclear online shops, inadequate customer services, annoying and too many commercials, lying, and not being transparent.<br>
Most used platforms:<em> Instagram and TikTok</em><br>
Usage: 	Daily; 1-3 hours a day, mainly in the morning and evening<br>
Preferred brand values: <em>Good price-quality balance, not too expensive, good reviews, not harmful to the environment or people, doing what it promises to do</em><br>
Brand turn-offs: High prices, unclear online shops, inadequate customer services, annoying and too many commercials, lying, and not being transparent <br><br>
<strong> Positioning of our Message: </strong> The message of our brand is that everyone should be treated equally and with respect. In this world it is still very difficult for women and minorities to speak up and many don't feel safe or pro-tected. We want to show that it is okay to speak up, want to make it easier for them to discomfort their feelings and make them feel their voice is being heard. Therefore, our core values are re-spect, self-determination, safety, and responsiveness. With our brand message is key. Our brand is bold, real, caring, and confident. With our message we want to make people think and appeal to their emotions. When our target audience sees for instance our logo or brand name, we want them to feel empowered, bold enough to speak up, and heard. <br><br>

Because we will be focusing on people from the Netherlands one of our competitors is RUMAG. RUMAG also targets people from the same ages as our audience and isn't too expensive. The brand is all about making a stand through several slogans. These can be shocking but also very funny. They sell these slogans through several products, such as bags, calendars, clothing, including sweaters. They started off as a social media brand and have therefore a big following. Besides RUMAG there are many brands that sell similar products as we do, sweaters with shocking taglines. However, we do differentiate as a brand by solely focusing on one topic for our message. Many of these brands, such as RUMAG are trying to make a stand in many different topics/ areas. By focusing on only one, we show our target audience that are full focus is on this message that we are trying to convey. What also happens a lot when looking at the slogans or taglines of other brands is that they are using humor to convey the messages. This way the message is a little less shocking and probably less people get offended. However, our brand is not about keeping everyone satisfied. We want to be serious and sometimes come across as shocking so people will really think about our message instead of laughing it off. We will, as mentioned before be a brand that is not expensive but do come with the quality that our audience expect of us. In our persona interviews we found out that our target audience values being real and honest, and doing what your promise to do when it comes to a brand. We will make sure that we fit this image because it is also in line with our core values.<br><br>

Looking at this, our brand positioning statement will be "For individuals looking for a way to make a stand and speak out their discomforts to men who don't respect their boundaries or are making them feel unsafe, VIRTYOU offers sweaters with a wide range of slogans – each slogan will be mak-ing men clear that our customer does not appreciate the way they treat them. Unlike other out-spoken brands, VIRTYOU solely focusses on this message and treating it with care while being seri-ous, honest, and real."
 </p>
		
   
<h4 class="content_subtext mt-4">Media Tactics</h4>
      <p>The platforms we will be using are TikTok and Instagram. We will be using these 2 media platforms as these are the most used by our target audience according to our research.<br><br>
 Among the many social media platforms there are, we choose TikTok because one of their biggest audience groups (41%) (Aslam, S., 2022) is between the age of 16 and 24. Not only does TikTok fall perfectly in our target audience, but the platform is also well known for 'going viral within a day'. This as TikTok creates an algorithm specialized to what the user views and likes. By using trending hashtags and popular sounds the chance of going viral is pretty high. As a starting brand this could help us build up a social media awareness among our target audience in the beginning stage of our marketing plan. <br>
<br>
As for our second platform, we choose Instagram for the same reasons as TikTok, it fits our target audience, this as one of the biggest target groups of Instagram is 18-24 years old (31%) (Statista, 2022). Nevertheless, the Instagram algorithm works different than that of TikTok. On Instagram you only get to see content of the people you follow, but it is easy to share posts of companies due to the broader communication methods Instagram uses, including group private messages and stories. Although the sharing options are broader, Instagram remains a platform that is more focused on the longer term. We will be using Instagram to keep our followers who came from our TikTok informed about the progression of the company and keep them hooked up after the viral TikTok video.<br>
<br>
 To sum thing up; TikTok will be our opening platform as it is easier to reach a bigger audience than on Instagram. In our TikTok videos we will be promoting our Instagram page so potential customers can keep up to date on our progress and can contain special content via our Instagram page.</p>

		<p><strong>Justification Brand Persona</strong><br>
			Demographic information: We interviewed youngsters between 18 and 27 years old. All interviewed youngsters live in the south of the Netherlands, and most of them are students, with a social side job, like sales or catering. According to our interview, they all had the problem we are examining, but women have had the problem more than men.<br><br>

Biography: Most interviewees are students with side jobs and play a sport. Almost all students mentioned watching films and series and being with their friends as things they do in their free time.<br><br>

Personality: The interviewees all said to be party introverted and extroverted. Most of them thought they were a little bit more extroverted. The feelings of being sensing versus intuitive differed, just like with thinking and feeling. Most participants said to be slightly more sensing than intuitive and slightly more feeling than thinking in everyday life. The participants agreed that they like to think of themselves as perceiving instead of judging, but every human judges sometimes. The participants value both family and work but find a family more important.<br><br>

Characteristics: The characteristics mentioned above are characteristics that the interviewees mentioned. 'Social' is one of the most mentioned ones.<br><br>

Quote: The interviewees valued respect for others and found it essential to listen to others instead of thinking and speaking for someone else. Most of them had a strong feeling of justice.<br><br>

Motivation and frustrations: Most youngsters mentioned they want to finish their studies, save money to live on, and get their own house while enjoying their life and living it to the fullest. On the other hand, lies and unfair behavior are not welcome in the interviewees' lives.<br><br>

Communication: Many different platforms are being used by our interviewees, mainly Instagram was mentioned a lot. However, TikTok was also mentioned as one of the apps the interviewees spent most of their time on. They use these apps for communication, for example, with friends and classmates, for information, through the news, and for entertainment, for instance, by watching small videos. They use these apps throughout the day, but especially when they wake up before they go to school and during their break from school/work. They estimated to spend three hours a day on all their social media combined.<br><br>

Brands: Most interviewees find it essential that the brand has a story, with which they mean the brand is transparent in what they do, how to do it, and what they stand for. They want to know the brand is doing 'fair business' and does not make unfair use of materials or people. The mentioned brands are not considered very expensive overall, but the interviewees don't mind paying a little extra when a brand is fair and transparent to them.<br><br>

Factors influencing buying behavior: Apart from the values mentioned above, a brand should be ethical, trustworthy, of good quality, and good customer service (friendly and fast) before the students consider buying the brand.
		</p>
		
		<h4 class="content_subtext mt-4">Visual Brand Identity</h4>
		<p>When we look at the personality of our brand, the words that describe it, our unique selling points (all mentioned in our brand identity), and core values, we have come up with the brand name: VirtYou. We use the word virtue, which "is the moral excellence of a person" (What Are Virtues?, 2019). When people are morally excellent, they have good virtues. They are, for instance, kind, respectful and honest. They do not act on their impulses and desires but upon values and principles. This is the core of our brand message. We changed 'Virtue' to 'VirtYou' because our brand encourages people to be morally excellent and confront those who aren't. We directly address anyone who is not behaving respectfully or ethically correct with this name.</p>
		
      <p><strong>Logo Version 1:</strong><br>
We have chosen to create a tiger as a logo because a tiger is known as a symbol of protection, awareness, and confidence, some words that correspond to our brand personality and values.
Red symbolizes action, confidence, courage, and change and is a powerful color that stands out!

We have decided not to use complicated lines or too much detail so that the main subject in our logo (the tiger) gets all the attention.
We have made the name of our brand name black but decided to make the 'YOU' part red because, with our name, we are bringing a message to our target audience. So, by making this, they will feel addressed.<br><br>
As feedback, we got back that the logo was too detailed, and the color red wasn't bold enough.
		  <img class="img-fluid about-the-brand-logo" src="images/First_Logo.png" alt="Placeholder Image"><br>
</p>
		
		<p><strong>Logo Version 2:</strong><br>
In our feedback session, someone suggested that we could leave some parts out, for instance, the eyes. We did this and made the color red as bright as possible.
<br><br>
In the second feedback session, we got back that this logo may be too much horror and the differences between line thickness looked a little weird.
			<img class="img-fluid about-the-brand-logo" src="images/Second_Logo.png" alt="Placeholder Image"><br>
</p>
		<p><strong>Logo Final Version:</strong><br>
We chose the design that multiple people in the last tutorial pointed out as the best one. We did adjust the lines and made them all the same thickness. We also chose a different font because we felt that the other one did not fit the boldness of our brand. We still wanted to go with a simple font that wouldn't take away the attention of the logo.
			<img class="img-fluid about-the-brand-logo" src="images/Final_Logo.png" alt="Placeholder Image"><br>
		</p>
			
			<p><strong>Product</strong><br>
Our brand sells three versions of sweaters: Only logo, Logo + Text, and only text. The sentences on the sweaters will be bold statements such as: "Fuck Off," "No is No," "Ask Before You Do," and "My Body My Rules." Firstly, we only wanted to put the logo on our sweaters because that was the only thing we were allowed to do. When our brand is a little more known amongst our customers, and they know what we represent, the logo would remind them of this. By only wearing a sweater with that logo, our customers already show the outside world that they don't appreciate transgressive behavior and want to feel safe, protected, and heard. But because we are a bold brand and received very good quotes when doing our problem interviews, we also wanted to put these on sweaters. Luckily, we heard during our marketing tutorial that this was okay. These statements are short but significant so that no one can avoid them. Now, our customers can choose themselves what they want to wear. For example, men who are supporting this brand but do not feel the need to wear these slogans because they don't feel like these are applying to them, they can still show support by wearing a sweater with just the logo.</p>

      </ul>
		
		<h4 class="content_subtext mt-4">Brand Identity</h4>
		<p><strong>Unique Selling Points</strong><br>
If we look at our brand identity, we have several unique selling points that set us apart from other brands. Our brand is all about the message: the message is key, and therefore, with our sweaters, for example, we will focus on making sure that the feel and design of the sweater matches the feeling of boldness, strength, and empowerment. Therefore, it will not be soft but rather a strong, somewhat rough material. Our brand distinguishes us from many other brands because we contribute to reducing/ or even the disappearance of a worldwide problem, namely women and minorities not feeling safe, protected, and heard while living in a patriarchal world. As a brand, we appeal to emotions associated with our products. Our brand will not be expensive and make people think about the current situation and how to better it through strong and bold quotes. This can sometimes come across as shocking. As a brand, we don't strive for women and minorities to be able to voice their discomforts more than men. We strive for as much safety and protection for women and minorities as men. The same goes for being able to express their feelings and discomforts. Therefore, our brand is inclusive. </p>

		<p><strong>Brand Personality:</strong><br>
We can define the personality of our brand with several words. First, our brand is tough, bold, and confident. The brand is meant to make clear statements even if that means some people will not like it. Secondly, our brand is real, honest, eye-opening, and caring. With our brand, we want to make people more aware of the current situation and, in the end, make it easier to confront others about their behavior. Lastly, our brand is contemporary. We attack an issue that is still very much present. </p><br>
