In her teenage years, she struggled a lot with being assertive, setting boundaries, and choosing herself every now and then. After going through some bad experiences herself, she decided to work on these aspects. She realized that everyone has the right to be assertive. Now she is a confident woman who knows what she wants and no longer avoids confrontation. She wishes that every woman and minority will feel one day the same way. "Everyone should be able to voice their boundaries just as everyone should accept these boundaries." </p>

Due to being raised among mostly boys within her family, Kim learned to stand her ground and knew how and when to speak up for herself. When Kim became a teenager, she noticed that other girls struggled with not knowing how to set their boundaries or how to stand up for themselves. She tried to help them by telling them her little tricks but she always wanted to do more for other woman and minorities who struggle to stand their ground. Now she is an adult who aspires to create awareness for this matter, this by drawing inspiration from her own youth. “I want everyone to be able and comfortable to voice their discomforts on the moments it matters the most”</p>

	 <p  class="brand-text">   <br>
VirtYou was founded in February 2022. The brand value is based on a lyric from Yellow by Coldplay, namely "I drew a line." We, Kim van den Ham, Michelle Schepers, and Alisha Wenas believe that, "In a world where people are still living in the rules of the past and patriarchy, we believe that it is vital that all people feel safe, protected, and able to voice their feelings and discomforts, because only then we can have a fair and civilized society." Nowadays, women and minorities are still treated different. They still encounter problems when it comes to boundary-crossing behavior. Many times the blame is placed on the people who do not dare to stand up for themselves. However, this world does not make these people feel safe and respect to actually speak up. We want to make it easier to stand up for yourself through our brand and products.<br>
	<br>
	Therefore, our brand values are:<br>
		 <strong>Self-Determination:</strong>Self-determination is very important to us and to this brand. In our vision we mention that we believe that people should be able to make their own decisions and show their limits. It should be their choice and initiative to where they want it to go and especially where they want it to stop. VirtYou wants to make clear that everyone has the right to have this self-determination.<br>
	<strong>Respect:</strong> Respect is also one of our core values. With VirtYou we want to contribute to the creation of more respect among people. Because we discuss an issue that involves a lot of respect, or better sad, a lack of respect. We try to change that. Also, we intend to always behave respectfully to our customers.<br>
		 <strong>Safety:</strong> Safety is our third core value, because looking at the issue we are discussing, the world we are living in now often still lacks this security. Cases as 'The Voice of Holland' show that for years the people who exhibited transgressive behavior could keep doing their thing without being punished for it. To bring awareness to this issue we hope we will contribute to more safety.<br>
	<strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Responsiveness is key to VirtYou. We want people to respond and to speak up, so that things like 'The Voice of Holland' cannot happen anymore. <br>
